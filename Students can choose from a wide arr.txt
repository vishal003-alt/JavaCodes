Students can choose from a wide array of courses and specializations that may not be available in local institutions 

 and the students can able to  learn from themself
so the self learning is helped to improve themself 

 Students can access course materials and lectures from anywhere with an internet connection

so from my point of you online learning is better than traditional learning.
